Python Daemons that seek out and deliver data to Mr. Burns (Glow 2014)

The Daemons
-----------

1. **Bart** - I take millions of lines of web server logs and throw them at Lisa. HAHA!
2. **Lisa** - I turn Bart's fun into geolocated data organized into aggregated buckets.
3. **Milhouse** - I do what Lisa tells me. In this case it's to take her data and package it into well-organized JSON files in 1 minute incriments.
